## üìù <span id="objective">Objective</span>
To write a simple UNIX command interpreter.
## <span id="introduction">Introduction</span>
This project is a simple Unix shell implementation written in C. It provides basic shell functionalities
such as command execution, built-in commands support, and environment variable handling.
This shell is designed to be lightweight and easy to understand, making it suitable for
learning purposes or as a base for building more complex shell environments.

## <span id="requirements">Requirements</span>
    
    Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
    All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
    All your files should end with a new line
    A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
    Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
    Your shell should not have any memory leaks
    No more than 5 functions per file
    All your header files should be include guarded
    Use system calls only when you need to (why?)

## <span id="compilation">Compilation</span>

Your shell will be compiled this way:

    `gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh`

## <span id="testing">Testing</span>

Your shell should work like this in interactive mode:

```
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
```

But also in non-interactive mode:

```
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
```
## <span id="files">Files description</span>
| Files     | Description                       |
| :------- | :-------------------------------- |
| `Authors` | Contains the names and email addresses of the various authors. |
| `environnement.c` | Contain The `environnement` function displays the currently defined environment variables. |
| `exec_commande.c` | Provides essential functionality for executing commands and searching for executables within the PATH, which are fundamental components of a shell program. |
| `main.c` | All the functions to handle various format specifers for our "printf" |
| `main.h` | Contain libraries and function prototype |
| `man_1_simple_shell` | The manual of our simple shell |
| `str_functions.c` | A set of utility functions commonly used in programs written in the C language. These functions are designed to facilitate string manipulation and access to environment variables in a program. |
| `token.c` | Provides functionality for counting individual commands in a string and tokenizing a string into an array of strings, which are common tasks in parsing user input in a shell program. |
##  <span id="install">How to install run and use our Simple Shell</span>
## Install and run

To install and run Simple Shell, follow these steps:

Clone the repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Pandolowitz/holbertonschool-simple_shell.git
```

Navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned.

Compile the program by running the following command:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh
```

Run the program by typing the following command:
```
./hsh
```

## <span id="using">Using the Simple Shell</span>

To use Simple Shell, type a command and press Enter.
<br>
The program will execute the command and display the output on the screen.

Here are some examples of commands that you can run:

- `ls`: list the contents of the current directory.
- `pwd`: print the path of the current working directory.
- `echo`: display a message on the screen.
- `mkdir`: create a new directory.
- `exit`: exit the shell.
- `ls -l`: list the contents of the current directory in long format.
